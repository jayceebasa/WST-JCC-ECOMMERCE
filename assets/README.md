# Assets Folder

This folder contains all static assets used throughout the WST JCC E-Commerce application.

## Structure

- **css/**: Contains all CSS stylesheets
- **js/**: Contains all JavaScript files
- **images/**: Contains all images used in the application (products, banners, backgrounds, etc.)
- **icons/**: Contains all icon files (SVG, PNG icons for UI elements)
- **fonts/**: Contains custom font files (if any custom fonts are used)

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive names for all assets
- Optimize images for web (compress for faster loading)
- Use consistent naming conventions (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- Organize images in subfolders if needed (e.g., products/, banners/, ui/)
- Keep CSS and JS files modular and well-documented
