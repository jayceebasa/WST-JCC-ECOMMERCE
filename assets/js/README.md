## JavaScript Organization Guidelines

1. **Main.js Structure**
   - Application initialization
   - Global event listeners
   - Main application logic
   - Imports/includes of other modules

2. **Best Practices**
   - Use ES6+ features when supported
   - Write modular, reusable functions
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep functions focused and single-purpose
   - Use consistent indentation and formatting
   - Group related functionality together
   - Avoid global variables when possible
